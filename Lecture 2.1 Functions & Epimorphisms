- If you can memoize a function -> It's a pure function!

- Functions are defined as special kinds of relations. Relation is when you take 2 sets with elements, and you can pair elements from one to another. One element from the first set (domain) cannot point to multiple in the mapping set (co-domain), but multiple elements from domain can map to same codomain element.

- If the above defined function maps from one set (domain) to another(codomain) and can map back to the original set, it has an incerse, such functions are called isomoprhisms.

*****************************************
Let A be domain set, and B be codomain set. A -> B

- Surjective: If every element of B has some A, multiple elements of A can point to same B

- Injective: Any element of B cannot have more than one element of A

- Bijective: A to B one to one perfectly
*****************************************

- Epimoprhism: In category theory, when a morphism is surjective we call it an epimorphism.
- Monomorphism/Monic: In category theory, when a morphism is injective we call it an epimorphism.
